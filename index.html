          <h3>Project Triangle Tracker</h3>
          <p>This project is about making the interface logic and business logic where the interface logic is a form made by three input places where the end user have </p>
          <p>to enter three different numbers which are the three lengths of the triangle and one button where the end user click to find which type of triangle. </p>
          <p>This Tracker help the Users to know  this is Triangle Equilateral ,Isocele,Scalene and not Triangle </p>
          <p> <strong>Equilateral Triangle:</strong>there has three sides are equal</p>
          <p> <strong>Isoceles triangle:</strong>There has three sides but two sides are equal.</p>
          <p><strong>Scalene triangle:</strong>There  has three sides but all sides aren't equal.</p>
          <p>Not a triangle:</p>
          <p>If Lenght1= Lenght2 and  Lenght1= Lenght3 and  Lenght2= Lenght3,the user has an equilateral triangle. </p><br>
          <p>If  Lenght1= Lenght2 or  Lenght1= Lenght3 or  Lenght2= Lenght3, the user has an isoceles triangle.</p> <br>
          <p>If all the above two conditions are not now it is a scalene triangle.</p>
             Lenght1 : <input type ="number" id="lenght1">
             Lenght2 : <input type ="number" id="lenght2">
             Lenght3 : <input type ="number" id="lenght3">
