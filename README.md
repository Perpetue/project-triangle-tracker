# PROJECT TRIANGLE TRACKER
##  My project created as project triangle tracker , 13 DEC 2018
#### By Moringa school,Wecode program

#### Description
This project is about making the interface logic and business logic where the interface logic is a form made by three input places where the end user have  to enter three different numbers which are the three lengths of the triangle and one button where the end user click to find which type of triangle. 
##### Setup instructions:
This is a great place to list setup instructions in a simple easy-to-understand.use google chrome and text-editor.
## BDD
| Behavior                                                         | Input     |  Output      |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------| :--------:| -----------: |
| when i put in 3 equal numbers it will say equilateral            | 9,9,9  |    Equilateral  |
| when i put in 2 equal numbers it will say  isosceles             | 12,12,21 |  Isosceles   |
| when i put in 3 different numbers it will say scalene            | 3,4,2  | Scalene      |
| when two parts are less than other part it will say Triangle     | 9,4,3 | No Triangle     |

## USER STORY

 As user, I want to enter the length values of the three sides of my triangle in the application.
 
 After submitting length, the application should tell me what type of triangle my length will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.
 
 For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
 For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
 For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
 Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.
